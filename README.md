The purpose of this analysis is to examine the viability of bike-share businesses.  By looking at Citibikes's metrics for volume, ridership, subscription base, and trip data, we can develop a business model for similar enterprises in other areas.

The busiest ride times are mornings between 8 and 9 and afternoons between 4 and 7. Thirty-three percent (33%) of bike check-outs occur in the afternoon timespan. Six o’clock is the top usage hour, representing 10% of the daily volume.

The graph shows the length of bike checkouts in minutes.  Five minutes is the maximum of the range. About 40% of the trips fall between 3 and 8 minutes.

Males make up the greatest portion of riders. Over a million and a half of the trips were made by men; that’s about 65%.

The subscriber base is the foundation of Citibikes’s ridership and ride volume, and males compose 72% of subscribers.  
 
Length of time per ride is roughly the same for all genders, and follows the same graph displaying duration ungrouped.

Citibikes has a robust, successful business model. Increasing ridership is an important goal and could be achieved by looking at geographic saturation; expansion into underserved areas; increasing the subscriber base; and investigating marketing to the female and other gender populations.  Visualizations that plot geo start and stop locations would be informative, as would satisfaction surveys of the current customer base.  Surveys targeted to non-users’ attitudes toward city biking could be an important piece of an expanded marketing plan. In addition to the geo modelling by trip, and total number of rides per day and week.
